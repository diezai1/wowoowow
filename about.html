    <h1>Personal life</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Fyodor Dostoevsky, one of Russia's most prominent literary figures, led a life filled with personal struggles, triumphs, and profound experiences that heavily influenced his writing.

            Dostoevsky was born on November 11, 1821, in Moscow, Russia. His father was a retired military surgeon. Dostoevsky's early life was comfortable, but his father's death in 1839 had a significant impact on him. He enrolled in the Military Engineering Academy in St. Petersburg but left to pursue a career in literature.
            
            In the 1840s, Dostoevsky became involved in radical intellectual circles. He was arrested in 1849 for allegedly participating in a socialist group and was sentenced to death. At the last moment, his sentence was commuted to hard labor in Siberia. His experiences in prison deeply influenced his worldview and are reflected in his later works.
            
            Dostoevsky married Maria Dmitrievna Isaeva in 1857. Their relationship was tumultuous, marked by financial struggles and Maria's declining health. She died of tuberculosis in 1864. Dostoevsky remarried Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina, who became his faithful companion and helped manage his affairs. They had a stable and supportive relationship.
            
            Throughout his life, Dostoevsky faced severe financial difficulties due to his gambling addiction and the publication failures of some of his works. He often found himself in debt and under pressure to produce successful novels to support his family.
            
            Dostoevsky's experiences, including his time in prison and his struggle with personal demons, deeply influenced his religious and philosophical beliefs. He underwent a profound spiritual transformation, which is evident in his later writings, where themes of redemption, suffering, and the search for meaning are prominent.
            
            Dostoevsky's literary career is marked by several masterpieces, including "Crime and Punishment," "The Brothers Karamazov," "The Idiot," and "Notes from Underground." His works explore complex psychological and moral themes, often delving into the depths of human nature.
            
            Dostoevsky continued to write prolifically until his death on February 9, 1881, in St. Petersburg, Russia. He left behind a legacy as one of the greatest novelists in world literature, whose works continue to spread across the world </li>
